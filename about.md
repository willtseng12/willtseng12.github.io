I am a recent college graduate from Vassar college with a BA in both philosophy and economics. I enjoy working with empirical data, wrapping my head in awesome codes, and persuing over 19th and 20th century philosophical texts. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and try to do so on a regular basis.
